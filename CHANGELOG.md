# Changelog

* Use joda-time's ZoneInfoCompiler (for bugfixes/consistency)

# 2.7.0

This release includes couple (possibly) breaking changes to previous versions of joda-time-android, depending on how
your project was configured.

#### Dependencies

Previously, joda-time-android included joda-time sources itself. Due to improvements made to the main project, it is
now possible for us to properly use the joda-time dependency. This means that:

1. If you are using Gradle, nothing should change, unless you were doing something weird.

2. If you're using Eclipse libraries, you will have to manually include joda-time.jar yourself now; make sure to
   get the no-tzdb artifact.

#### Initialization

Initially you initialized the library via `ResourceZoneInfoProvider.init()`. Later this was moved to
`JodaTimeAndroid.init()`. We're removing the other endpoint because it just makes this more difficult to
maintain; it should be simple to change from one to the other.
